This directory contains your processed music analytics files.
After running the Python data processor, copy the resulting JSON files here so the React dashboard can load them from the `/data/` path.
Expected files:
  - `lifetime_streaming_stats.json`
  - `annual_recaps.json`
  - `artist_summary.json`
  - `concerts.json`
