Q055,"Let us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation. Why should we desecrate noble and beautiful souls by intruding on them? Why insist on rash personal relations with your friend?

I can get politics and chat, and neighborly conveniences from cheaper companions.",Ralph Waldo Emerson,Essay on Friendship,5,Friendship,,,2016-01-01
Q056,"Let him not cease an instant to be himself. The only joy I have in his being mine, is that the not mine is mine.

Q062,"The laws of friendship are austere and eternal, of one web with the laws of nature and of morals. But we have aimed at a swift and petty benefit, to suck a sudden sweetness.

Q208,"My favorite concept of the book is that of pain-body. Every emotional pain we experience leaves behind a residue of pain that lives on in us. This accumulated pain is a negative energy field that occupies the body and mind. It is the emotional pain-body. It has two modes of being: dormant and active. It may be dormant most of the time, but it can be triggered by certain situations that resonate with a pain pattern such as past moments of failure, loneliness, depression etc. 

The natural reaction is to unconsciously identify with it. That is why it is so terrifying to start to feel depressed. It is the memory of the pain-body more than the current emotion. Depressed moods spur on all emotional memories of being depressed--causing a person to feel like they have always been depressed. Simply recognizing this truth (that the pain-body is a pseudo-self) allows acceptance of the depressed emotion, which brings peace. 

The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it. The identification is now broken and the higher dimension of consciousness of presence comes in. Refusing to identify with the pain-body by recognizing that it is not you, will allow the painful emotion to eventually subside as you watch it, instead of it festering and deepening.",Summary - Zach Stanford,Power of Now,5,Book Summary,,,2016-01-01

Q260,"When someone is seeking, it happens quite easily that he only sees the thing that he is seeking; that he is unable to find anything, unable to absorb anything, because he is only thinking of the thing he is seeking, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed with his goal.

Often when people are really given the chance to open up, they unravel their own problems and the solutions become clear to them in the process.

We like to continue to believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it.

It was more than just a pump-up motivational book--the lessons here are real and deep and come with powerful stories.

Q906,My brain surgery was an inflection point in my life. It gave me a victorious mentality that I could do hard things and overcome. I had to choose to fight for my life at the age of 11 rather than just drifting through life. There was a point when I couldn’t talk—my words all mumbled together and I couldn’t walk or use a pencil. I had to relearn all these skills and this conscious effort to do basic things left me with gratitude for everything.,Zach Stanford,On Fire,,Personal Reflections,,,2019-02-03
Q907,Be like Jack Buck. He paid attention to others around him. His life wasn’t about him. He didn’t keep score. His time wasn’t about what he could get.

Q915,"There is a fear of being demonized that is rapidly growing where if you voice opinions that are contrary to the majority, people will protest against you. This is a problem because it encourages group think and limits the though conversations of trying to understand the other side. I was maybe coddled a bit too much growing up where I was made to believe that hearing other ideas contrary to mine was unsafe because it might corrupt me. Maybe that is true for a child but it doesn’t hold up for adults. I should seek out opinions on both sides to increase my understanding and empathy.

Q1077,"My favorite concept of the book is that of a â€œpain-bodyâ€_x009d_. Every emotional pain we experience leaves behind a residue of pain that lives on in us. This accumulated pain is a negative energy field that occupies the body and mind. Itâ€™s the emotional pain-body. It has two modes of being: dormant and active. It may be dormant most of the time, but it can be triggered by certain situations that resonate with a pain pattern such as past moments of failure, loneliness, depression etc. 
 The natural reaction is to unconsciously identify with it. That is why it is so terrifying to start to feel depressed. It is the memory of the pain-body more than the current emotion. Depressed moods spur on all emotional memories of being depressed--causing a person to feel like they have always been depressed. Simply recognizing this truth (that the pain-body is a pseudo-self) allows acceptance of the depressed emotion, which brings peace. 
 The moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into it. The identification is now broken and the higher dimension of consciousness of presence comes in. Refusing to identify with the pain-body by recognizing that it is not you, will allow the painful emotion to eventually subside as you â€œwatchâ€_x009d_ it, instead of festering and deepening.",Summary - Zach Stanford,Power of Now,5,"Acceptance,Depression,Peace",,,2014-07-01

Q1082,"It is not true that the up cycle is good and the down cycle is bad, except in the mind's judgment. Growth is usually considered positive, but nothing can grow forever.

Q1084,"When listening to another person, don't just listen with your mind, listen with your whole body. Feel the energy field of your inner body as you listen.

Q1093,"Focus attention on the feeling inside you. Know that it is the pain-body. Accept that it is there. Donâ€™t think aboutâ€”donâ€™t let the feeling turn into thinking. Donâ€™t judge or analyze. Donâ€™t make an identity for yourself out of it. Stay present, and continue to be the observer of what is happening inside you.

We like to continue to believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it.

Business is full of men who would be at the top if they had only learned to think their thoughts out to a conclusion. They know that two and two make four, but they never stop to think 'four of what.' Many of these halfway folks get by, but they never get far.
