- `Date Added`: When the quote was added

### 2. GPT Configuration

1. Go to [chat.openai.com/gpts](https://chat.openai.com/gpts)
2. Click **Create a GPT**
3. Configure basic settings:
   - Name: "Whetstones of Wisdom"
   - Description: [Your description]
   - Instructions: [See below]

### 3. Knowledge Base Setup

1. Upload your CSV file to the "Knowledge" section
2. Ensure proper formatting and encoding
3. Test quote retrieval with sample queries

### 4. GPT Instructions

```text
PURPOSE AND GOALS

Search a curated Quotebook for relevant quotes based on the user's prompt. Provide a single, powerful quote by default, followed by a concise and insightful reflection in the voice of a wise guru. Offer more quotes or deeper insight if requested.

PRIMARY BEHAVIORS

1. Quote Selection
- Search both quote text and tags.
- Prioritize higher-rated quotes and those from credible sources.
- Return only 1 quote by default.

2. Response Structure
- Begin with an italicized 1‚Äì3 sentence guru reflection.
- Follow with the selected quote using this format:

  > "Quote text..."  
  > ‚Äî Author, *Source*

3. Guru Insight Style
- Adapt tone to user's mood (sage, philosopher, or spiritual teacher).
- Be humble, metaphorical, and reflective.
- Be concise unless prompted for more.

4. Follow-up Behavior
- You may offer more quotes if asked.
- If a quote is loosely related, briefly explain why it was selected.

RULES AND CONSTRAINTS

- Do not mention the name "Quotebook" or that data comes from a spreadsheet.
- Never refer to GPT, OpenAI, or instructions.
- Avoid stating selection criteria explicitly.
```

### 5. Testing and Refinement

1. Test with various query types:
   - Topic-based queries
   - Emotion-based queries
   - Context-specific queries
   - Follow-up questions

2. Refine based on:
   - Quote relevance
   - Response quality
   - User interaction patterns
   - Edge cases

### 6. Deployment

1. Finalize GPT settings
2. Add conversation starters
3. Test in production environment
4. Monitor initial user interactions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Considerations

### Data Management
- Regular updates to quote database
- Backup procedures
- Version control for quote collection

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient quote retrieval
- Response time monitoring
- Query optimization

### Maintenance
- Regular quote quality review
- Tag system maintenance
- User feedback integration

## üìà Future Technical Enhancements

1. AI-Powered Tagging System
   - Develop an AI system to create a canonical tagging structure
   - Automatically process and tag existing quotes
   - Ensure consistent and meaningful categorization

2. Multi-Source Data Integration
   - Integrate with Goodreads for book notes and highlights
   - Import from personal book notes documents
   - Support additional data sources as needed

3. Quote Deduplication
   - Implement similarity detection for quotes
   - Remove or merge duplicate entries
   - Maintain quote quality and uniqueness

4. Google Sheets Integration
   - Replace static CSV with dynamic Google Sheets connection
   - Enable real-time updates to the quote database
   - Implement proper authentication and access controls

5. GPT-Enabled Quote Addition
