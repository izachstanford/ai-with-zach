# From Spreadsheet to AI: Building Whetstones of Wisdom

*How a decade-old dream of making wisdom accessible became reality in just a few hours with AI*

---

## The Origin Story

Back in 2014, my mentor and friend Dave Carlston shared something special with me: his personal quotebook. This wasn't just any collection of quotesâ€”it was a carefully curated spreadsheet containing over 1,000 profound insights from various sources. I spent hours poring over these gems, manually tagging each one with topical categories, dreaming of a day when this wisdom could be more easily accessible.

Dave and I often talked about building a tool that would make these quotes more discoverable and engaging. But like many good ideas, it remained in the spreadsheet, only occasionally accessed for specific searches.

## The Personal Journey

As an avid reader of nonfictionâ€”from business and self-improvement to biographies, spirituality, and parentingâ€”I've continued this tradition of collecting wisdom. My Google Sheet grew over the years, expanding to over 1000 quotes that inspired paradigm shifts or offered fresh perspectives. Each entry was a bookmark of insight, waiting for the right moment to be shared.

## The AI Revolution

Fast forward to 2025, and the landscape has changed dramatically. What once seemed like a complex development project became possible in just a few hours thanks to AI. I'm excited to share Whetstones of Wisdom, a custom GPT that brings these collected insights to life in a way I could only dream of a decade ago.
