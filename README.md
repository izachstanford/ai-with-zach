# 🧠 AI Projects — Zach Stanford

Welcome to my personal lab of agentic AI projects, where I build tools to automate my personal life, experiment with LLM-powered automations, and explore the frontier of personal AI.

> Built with OpenAI, Goose, Google Cloud, Python, Streamlit, and other tools in my engineering stack.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Zach Stanford — a thought leader and builder with a background in AI analytics, semantic layers, data insights, and business intelligence systems. I’ve spent the last 10+ years at companies like Block, DoorDash, and Goldman Sachs working on internal data platforms to democratize data and insights.

I have a unique mix of hands-on engineering skill and product leadership experience, and I'm especially passionate about building LLM-powered systems that feel less like tools and more like intelligent collaborators.

## 🧠 Planned Projects

This repo is where I prototype and refine agentic AI systems to support health, creativity, and knowledge work. Upcoming projects:

### 📚 QuoteBook Agent  
Surface curated quotes (1,000+ from books I’ve read) from Google Sheets. Filter by topic, author, or keyword. Future vision includes contextual quote suggestions and integrations into journaling, reflection, or writing tools.

### 🏃‍♂️ Fitness Coach (Strava + LLM)  
Generate daily workout recommendations based on recent training data from Strava. Balances training load, recovery, and long-term performance. Aims to maximize gains while reducing injury risk.

### 🎧 Spotify Listening Dashboard  
A Streamlit dashboard that analyzes my Spotify listening data to visualize genre diversity, top artists, and historical listening patterns.

### 🗂️ Google Drive Assistant  
Create an AI-powered agent that indexes and retrieves notes, summaries, and information across my personal Google Docs and Sheets. This will function as a second brain and knowledge archive.

### 🌐 Portfolio Website  
A public-facing site that presents these projects with descriptions, live demos, and blog-style breakdowns—intended to support consulting, collaboration, and community learning.

### ⚙️ Agentic Automation Playground  
Experiments with task automation, calendar integration, file workflows, and CLI agents. This section will be home to emerging ideas that don’t yet fit neatly elsewhere.

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

When working locally:

1. Always activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate```

2. Install new packages as needed, then update requirements:

```bash
pip install <package-name>
pip freeze > requirements.txt```

3. Run Streamlit apps (if applicable) with:


```bash
streamlit run <filename>.py```


4. When done:

```bash
deactivate```
